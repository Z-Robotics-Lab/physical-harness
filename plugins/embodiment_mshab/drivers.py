"""The mshab rollout driver: a frozen random-action policy.

The heterogeneous episodic protocol (workload._governed_segment): the episode
driver binds each sub-goal itself via ``enter_segment(env, seg_spec)`` and
reports its own truth via ``segment_success(env)``. This driver's ONE sub-goal
is "drive a parameterized rollout" -- actions are seeded-uniform samples from
the env's action space (MshabEnv.sample_action, rng seeded per episode), so a
same-seed brief replays the same stream. Its segment truth is "the rollout
drove at least one step"; the env's own (unaudited) success flag rides
segment_diagnostics, never a gate. Swap the ref in mission_mshab_rollout's
binding for a checkpoint-backed provider when a trained policy lands.
